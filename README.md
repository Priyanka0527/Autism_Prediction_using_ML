# Autism_Prediction_using_ML
Abstract :
Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a complex neurodevelopmental condition 
characterized by challenges in social interaction, communication, and repetitive 
behaviors. Early detection of ASD is crucial for timely intervention, which can 
significantly improve the quality of life for affected individuals and their families. 
Traditional diagnostic methods rely heavily on clinical observations and standardized 
testing, which can be time-consuming and subjective.
 This project aims to develop a machine learning-based model to detect autism using 
demographic, behavioral, and historical data. By leveraging a dataset containing 
features such as age, gender, ethnicity, presence of jaundice at birth, prior usage of 
autism screening apps, and familial relations, we aim to create a predictive model that
 can assist in the early detection of ASD. The data is preprocessed to handle missing 
values and categorical variables, followed by feature scaling to standardize the inputs.
Here I implement several machine learning algorithms, including Decision Trees, Support 
Vector Machines, and Random Forests, to identify the most effective model. The 
models are trained and validated using an 80-20 train-test split, and their 
performance is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, 
and the ROC-AUC curve.
Here results indicate that the Random Forest classifier provides the best performance, 
achieving high accuracy and robust predictive capabilities. The feature importance 
analysis reveals key factors that contribute to the prediction of ASD, providing insights
 into the most significant indicators of the disorder.
 The proposed machine learning approach offers a promising supplementary tool for 
early autism detection, potentially enabling healthcare professionals to identify at-risk 
individuals more efficiently and accurately. This project underscores the potential of 
machine learning in enhancing diagnostic processes and highlights the importance of 
integrating technological advancements in medical practice.
